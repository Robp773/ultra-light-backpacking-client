# Pack Light

# Live Demo

# Introduction

Pack Light is an app that was designed to simplify the process of cutting down a backpacker's baseweight and getting a sense of what weight improvements can be made to your packing list. Reaching 'ultra light' status with your backpack's weight can be a tough milestone to reach and many times involves writing out a long list of items, weights, and categories to get a sense of what you can and can't afford to take. This app enables the user to keep track of this long list, edit it's contents, and save them for later use. 

# Directions

Once the app has started, either enter a list name for a new list, or select one of your previously saved lists to open. When a new list has been created, choose your base weight goal and start adding items to the list to track your progress towards that goal. 

To add a new item to the list, expand a category bar by clicking on it, and click the '+' button to open an item adding form. 

To edit an existing list item simply enter a new value for it's name or weight sections.

Deletion is triggered by the trashcan button next to each list item. 

Remember to save your changes by clicking on the floppy disk button!
